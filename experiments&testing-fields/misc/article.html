      tl;dr I made this article with HTML and use it to explain DOM, window,
      document and how to manipulate/interface with those things with
      JavaScript.

    <h1>What is the DOM?</h1>
    <p>
      The
      <abbr id="dom-abbr-id" title="Document Object Model">DOM</abbr>
      essentially, is a representation of a document as a tree structure. The
      parts of the tree structure branches are nodes, those nodes contain
      objects. Let's take a moment to get an example of what something like this
      might look like, and open up the browser console and you can copy & paste
      then into the console
      <code> document.getElementsByTagName('abbr')</code> what you get back
      should look something like <code>HTMLCollection[abbr]</code> now what is
      this? Well, it is an array-like (so not an array exactly) object of the
      elements. So this is an example of many elements being found coming back
      but we only have one "abbr" Element but if we were to pass in
      <code>document.getElementsByTagName('code')</code> we would get a large
      collection coming back because I am using that tag A ALOT lol.
    </p>
    <p>
      So let's dig a little into grabbing a specific Element and utilizing some
      Node and Element methods.
